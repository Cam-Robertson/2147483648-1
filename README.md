## Disclaimer
2147483648 was originally created by CyberZHG, and was forked by mdehghani and then again forked by me. I made four different 2048 games - each with different sizes - and different goals. They're easier to achieve. That's why I shifted the goals to a higher number.
One more is coming soon. Those extra repos are part of the 2147483648 repo. What I edited was the HTML and CSS file for higher grid 

You can find and follow me on Github [right here.](https://github.com/theastronomer)

## Project work?
I made this in my spare time, and it's hosted on GitHub!

Enjoy the game!

Man, the highest record in Threes is 832K, by the way. I never reached 6144.

Plus 144 is a Fibonacci number. :smile:
