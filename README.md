## Disclaimer
This site is a clone of [2147483648](https://cyberzhg.github.io/2048/) by CyberZHG, which was originally based on Gabriele Cirulli's [2048](https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/), which is based on [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024), and conceptually similar to [Threes](https://asherv.com/threes/).

NEW: I added 2 other clones of 2147483648 - [2147483648 - Size 32](https://rawgit.com/TheAstronomer/2147483648/size32/index.html) and [2147483648 - Animated Edition](https://rawgit.com/TheAstronomer/2147483648/size32/index.html). The first one can support grid sizes up to 32x32, and the second one has cooler designs and animated tiles! I also added Lucas numbers (2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76...) and Troll mode (moves in random directions whenever you make a move) to the game and it is available on all 2147483648 sites. The game has been modified for endless gameplay too!

## Project work?
I made this in my spare time, and it's hosted on GitHub, which means there are no hosting costs.

Enjoy the game!
