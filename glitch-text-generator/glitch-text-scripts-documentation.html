        <h1>glitch text scripts documentation</h1>

        <p>last revised: may 31, 2015</p>

        <p>In recent years, artists such as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/glitchr">Glitchr</a>
            have helped popularize a certain style of "glitch text" that revolves around the use of
                <a
                href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/block/combining_diacritical_marks/index.htm"
                >combining diacritical marks</a>. These marks are highly stackable, and stacking
            large numbers of them can lead to interesting/unexpected results. </p>

        <p>These scripts use (pseudo)random numbers to rapidly generate this type of glitch text.
            The accompanying <a href="generator.html">HTML5 glitch text generator</a> can be used to
            generate glitch text for copy-pasting to social media, or as an art canvas for creating
            text art.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Update:</strong> for stripped-down versions of these scripts designed for online mouseovers, <a href="http://animalswithinanimals.com/generator/glitch-text-mouseover-tutorial.html">go here.</a></p>

        <p>glitch-text-scripts.js currently contains three scripts for adding random diacritical
            marks to text:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><span class="codefont">glitchText()</span> picks one character at random from the
                source text and adds a random diacritic after it.</li>
            <li><span class="codefont">glitchAll()</span> adds a different random diacritic after
                every character in the source text. Note that this includes diacritics you already
                added, so these add up fast!</li>
            <li><span class="codefont">glitchAllSame()</span> picks one random diacritic and adds it
                after every character in the source text. </li>

        </ul>

        <p>Each of these scripts takes up to four arguments:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><span class="codefont">id1</span> is the ID of the element containing the text you
                want to glitch. This can be an &lt;input&gt; or a standard HTML element such as
                &lt;p&gt;, &lt;a&gt;, &lt;span&gt;, etc. This argument is required.</li>
            <li><span class="codefont">id2</span> is the ID of the element where you want to output
                the glitched text. If this is left blank, then is is assumed that you want to
                replace the source text with the glitched text, and id1 is used.</li>
            <li>Pass <span class="codefont">true</span> to the <span class="codefont">isInput</span>
                argument to tell the script that the source text is coming from an &lt;input&gt;
                element (or I guess &lt;select&gt;). For example, my glitch text generator uses form
                inputs like these to print to the screen in real-time. Leaving this argument blank
                (or passing any value that doesn't resolve true) indicates that the source text is
                coming from a standard HTML element.</li>
            <li>Pass <span class="codefont">true</span> to the <span class="codefont"
                    >copyBack</span> argument if you're using different source and output elements,
                and you want the glitched text to be "copied back" into the source element and
                replace its content. This could be important if working with form inputs, for
                example (it's crucial to my HTML5 glitch text generator). Leaving this blank (or
                passing any value that doesn't resolve true) means you don't want or need this.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>There are also two "precise" scripts, which allow the user to choose which diacritic to
            use instead of picking one at random.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><span class="codefont">glitchTextPrecise()</span> picks one character at random from
                the source text and inserts the specified diacritic after it. Functions the same as
                    <span class="codefont">glitchText()</span> except it has two more arguments. The
                fifth, <span class="codefont">diacritic</span>, is obviously required. This should
                either hold a numeric value between 768 and 879 (the combining diacritics block; I
                suppose you could send it other values if you wanted to insert some other random
                character for some reason), or the ID of a select/input element holding a number in
                this range. If passing an ID, then you must also pass <span class="codefont"
                    >true</span> to the sixth argument, <span class="codefont">isInput2</span>. </li>
            <li><span class="codefont">glitchAllPrecise()</span> inserts the specified diacritic
                after every character in the source text. Functions the same as <span
                    class="codefont">glitchAll()</span> except for the fifth and sixth arguments,
                    <span class="codefont">diacritic</span> and <span class="codefont"
                    >isInput2</span> (see previous bullet for how to use these).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>There are also "scramble" scripts that replace each character in the source text with a
            different random character:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><span class="codefont">randomizeText()</span> replaces every character in the source
                text with a random character. It takes the same four arguments as the glitch scripts
                listed above.</li>
            <li><span class="codefont">randomizeTextInRange()</span> is the same as <span
                    class="codefont">randomizeText()</span> except it allows you to specify the
                range of characters to be generated using the fifth and sixth arguments, <span
                    class="codefont">startRange</span> and <span class="codefont">endRange</span>.
                Values for these arguments must be numbers, and the numbers should represent
                    <em>HTML entities</em> for Unicode characters. For example, the HTML entity for
                    <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0041/index.htm">uppercase
                    A</a> is <span class="codefont">&amp;#65;</span>, so if you wanted to start with
                A, you would pass the value "65" to <span class="codefont">startRange</span>.</li>
            <li><span class="codefont">randomizeBlock()</span> is a shortcut to <span
                    class="codefont">randomizeTextInRange()</span>. Instead of supplying specific
                start and end values, this script allows you to supply a name for a predefined block
                of characters. Check the source code for the full list of acceptable values.</li>
        </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Update:</strong> the <code>glitchAll</code> and <code>Randomize</code> scripts have a new attribute.
            This optional attribute (last in attribute list) is <code>skipSpace</code>; pass it <code>true</code> to make
            these scripts recognize and skip space characters (<code>&amp;#20;</code>). This is handy for maintaining word wrap.</p>

        <p>glitch-text-scripts.js also contains four helper scripts that the base scripts rely
            upon:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Some types of text are picky about which diacritical marks they accept, so <span
                    class="codefont">randomNumFromLetter()</span> accepts one character as input,
                and tries to pick a random diacritic from the appropriate range based on that
                character. </li>
            <li><span class="codefont">String.prototype.splice()</span> is used to insert content
                into the middle of the string. Thanks to <a
                    href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4313841/javascript-how-can-i-insert-a-string-at-a-specific-index"
                    >stackoverflow user 113716</a> for the code.</li>
            <li><span class="codefont">String.prototype.removeAt()</span> is used to replace
                characters in the middle of the string.</li>
            <li><span class="codefont">randomFromInterval()</span> is used to generate a
                (pseudo)random number within a given range. Thanks to <a
                    href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4959975/generate-random-value-between-two-numbers-in-javascript"

        </ul>

        <h2>Terms of [mis]use</h2>

        <p>You may use glitch text and text art that you create using the HTML5 glitch text
            generator in any way. It's your art; I just made the tool. If you choose to publish your
            art, it would be great if you could include a link to <a
                href="http://animalswithinanimals.com/generator/"
                >animalswithinanimals.com/generator/</a>. Also, I'd love it if you submitted your
            screenshots, animated gifs, etc to the <a href="http://glitchtext.tumblr.com">glitch
                text tumblr</a> at <a href="http://glitchtext.tumblr.com/submit"
                >glitchtext.tumblr.com/submit</a>.</p>
        <p>You may use the glitch text scripts in your own projects. If you do, it's better for me
            if you upload the file to your own server than if you link to my server. You may alter
            the scripts if your project requires it, but don't try to pass it all off as your own
            work, because that would be a total jerk move. Also, don't try to make money off these
            scripts without cutting me in on the deal, because that's not cool, either.</p>
        <p>If you use the scripts in a project, it would be great if you could include a link to <a
                href="http://animalswithinanimals.com/generator/"
                >animalswithinanimals.com/generator/</a>. If you do something interesting with these
            scripts or expand them in some cool way, I'd love if you let me know by emailing me at
            stallio@animalswithinanimals.com or submitting a link to the <a
                href="http://glitchtext.tumblr.com">glitch text tumblr</a> at <a
                href="http://glitchtext.tumblr.com/submit">glitchtext.tumblr.com/submit</a>.</p>

        <h2>Questions/comments/feedback</h2>

        <p>I'm not a professional programmer and my code is probably lousy with bugs and unintended
            errors (the bad kind, I mean). Likewise, there are probably some amazing features that I
            could add to the scripts or the HTML5 generator that I haven't thought of. Shoot me an
            email at stallio@animalswithinanimals.com with your comments, code suggestions,
            questions, kudos, or other laudations. Hate mail should be sent directly to the
            trash.</p>
