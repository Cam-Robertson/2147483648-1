included files:
    glitch-text-scripts.js -- JavaScript file you can include in your own projects
    glitch-text-howto.html -- tips for using the HTML5 glitch text generator
    glitch-text-scripts-documentation.html -- documentation for the scripts
    glitchtext-bg1.png -- a cool background image for documentation pages
    
also includes all three versions of the text-art canvas so you can use them while offline:
    generator.html -- standard version
    generator-big.html -- has larger "touch-friendly" controls (Safari/Chrome only)
    generator-ie.html -- for Internet Explorer 10 & other/older browsers that don't support HTML5 well
    
To use the HTML5 glitch text generators while offline, just unzip these files into the same folder, 
& then open the desired file in your web browser.
