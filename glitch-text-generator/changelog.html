        <h1>glitch text generator/scripts&mdash;change log</h1>
        <p>last updated: May 31, 2015</p>
            
            <h2>v.1.1.2&mdash;May 31, 2015</h2>
            
            <p>The glitch text scripts now recognize and skip spaces (if you want them to)! This is turned on by default in the glitch text generator; uncheck the <em>Spaces</em> checkbox at the top of the page to turn it off.</p>
            
            <p>This is done using a new optional <code>skipSpace</code> attribute on the <code>glitchAll</code> and <code>Randomize</code> scripts. Pass <code>true</code> to these scripts to turn this on.</p>
            
            <h2>v1.1.1&mdash;January 2015</h2>
            
            <p>Added lots more animations.</p>
            
            <h2>v1.1&mdash;December 2014</h2>
            
            <p>Added a new <strong>animate panel</strong> with five categories of CSS animations that you can mix &amp; match. The duration of each animation can be set independently.</p>
            
            <h2>mouseover scripts&mdash;July 2014</h2>
            
            <p>Implemented the <a href="http://animalswithinanimals.com/generator/glitch-text-mouseover-tutorial.html">glitch text mouseovers</a> as a separate script file to make them more easy to use in websites.</p>
            
            <h2>v1.0.5&mdash;June 2014</h2>
            
            <p>Added a new <strong>pos panel</strong> with x and y sliders that allow you to move things around more easily on the screen.</p>
            
            <h2>v1.0.4&mdash;May, 2014</h2>
            
            <p>Added a few more fonts to the font drop-down, to make it easier to play around with dingbats. New fonts are Webdings, Wingdings, Wingdings 2, Wingdings 3.</p>
            
            <h2>v1.0.3&mdash;March 15, 2014</h2>
            <p>Added a text box to the font panel, so now you can use virtually any font you have installed&mdash;just type the font name in the box and click Go!</p>
            <p>Also added two new options to the scramble panel&mdash;Basic ASCII and Extended ASCII&mdash;for use with display fonts that don't have a lot of characters.</p>
            
            
            <h2>v1.0.2&mdash;Feb. 01, 2014</h2>
            <p>Added almost 20 new options to the scramble panel. Many of these new options require a font like Code2000&mdash;<a href="http://www.fontspace.com/james-kass/code2000">get Code2000 for free here</a>.</p>
            
            <h2>v1.0.1&mdash;Dec. 01, 2013</h2>
            <p>Users reported that chars <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0340/index.htm">U+0340</a> and 
                <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0340/index.htm">U+0341</a> don't play well with facebook, so these were removed
            from the "random" scripts. They are still available via the precise panel.</p>
            <p>Added several new options to the scramble panel: Braille, Galgolithic, Coptic, Tifinagh,
            Vai, Linear B, Cypriot, Phaistos Disc, More Symbols, Transport, Alchemical, Supplemental Punctuation.</p>
            <p>Added <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/block/combining_diacritical_marks_for_symbols/list.htm">Combining
            Diacritical Marks for Symbols</a> to the precise panel. <i>These only work in FreeSans, FreeSerif, and Symbola</i>,
                so if you want to use them, you'll need to <a href="http://shapecatcher.com/unicodefonts.html">install those fonts</a> 
                (they're free!). You'll probably also want to use "FreeFonts mode" (see below).</p>
            <p>Added a FreeFonts button that makes it easier to work with chars that are only visible in the Free* fonts or Symbola.
            Clicking this button:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Changes the font of the "type something" boxes to Symbola, which is great for working with Pictographs and such.</li>
                <li>Changes the font of the "choose diacritic" drop-downs to FreeSans, so you can work with diacritics that aren't in the base fonts
                (like the newly-added Combining Diacritical Marks for Symbols).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There is of course also a Base fonts button for switching back out of FreeFonts mode.</p>
