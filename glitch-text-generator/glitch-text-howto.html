        <h1>Using the glitch text generator and text art canvas</h1>
        <p>last updated: December 01, 2013</p>
        <h2>About this project</h2>
        <p>In recent years, artists such as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/glitchr">Glitchr</a>
            have helped popularize a certain style of "glitch text" that revolves around the use of
                <a
                href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/block/combining_diacritical_marks/index.htm"
                >combining diacritical marks</a>. These marks are highly stackable, and stacking
            large numbers of them can lead to interesting/unexpected results. </p>

        <p>The <a href="generator.html">HTML5 glitch text generator</a> can be used to rapidly
            generate this type of glitch text for copy-pasting to social media or elsewhere, and also
            functions as a canvas for creating text art.</p>

        <h2>Browser requirements/recommendations</h2>
        <p>The <a href="http://animalswithinanimals.com/generator/generator.html">glitch text
                generator and text art canvas</a> is built using HTML5 and JavaScript. As such, you
            must be using a newer browser, and you must not have JavaScript disabled.</p>
        <p>The generator uses the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_form_input_types.asp"
                >HTML5 color input</a>, which is not fully supported in all browsers. Chrome and
            Opera provide a color picker tool, where other browsers will only show a text box that
            accepts <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colors.asp">hex color values</a>. </p>
        <p>Webkit browsers (Chrome and Safari) have an optimization bug that can result in artifacts
            being left onscreen when glitch text is resized or rotated. As such, you will get the
            more unpredictable and "glitchier" results if using one of these browsers.</p>
        <h3>Mobile and tablet devices</h3>
        <p><strong>iOS:</strong> Works well in Safari, particularly if you're using 
            the <a href="generator-big.html">touch-friendly glitch text generator</a>, which has larger 
            controls that are easier to use with a touch interface than the small controls in the baseline version.</p>
        <p><strong>Android:</strong> Does not work in the built-in browesr. Users report it does work in other browsers like Chrome.
        There is probably a minimum version of Android required. I don't currently know what it is :/</p>
        <p><strong>Chrome OS:</strong> Works great in Chrome and thus <i>should</i> work on any Chrome tablets.</p>    
        <p><strong>Other:</strong> Might or might not work on Windows phones or other OSes. If you have one, try it out and
            let me know if/how it works.</p>
        <h2>The controls</h2>
        <p>The glitch text canvas can display up to four lines of glitched text, with
            user-selectable type formatting including shadow and rotation. Each line has a size
            control and five collapsible formatting panels: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <strong>random panel</strong> is visible by default. It contains three buttons
                for generating random glitch text: <ul>
                    <li>The <strong>&aacute;</strong> button adds a random diacritic to one
                        character in the source text.</li>
                    <li><strong>a&#771;a&#793;a&#831;</strong> adds a different random diacritic
                        after every character in the source text (including other diacritics, so
                        these add up fast!).</li>
                    <li><strong>&aacute;&aacute;&aacute;</strong> picks one random diacritic and
                        adds it after every character in the source text (including other
                        diacritics).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The <strong>precise panel</strong> lets the user select a diacritic and add it after
                either one random character or every character in the source text. It is collapsed
                by default.</li>
            <li>The <strong>scramble panel</strong> lets you "randomize" the text by replacing every
                character in the source text (including diacritics) with a different character. It
                has a drop-down menu that lets you choose different character ranges: <ul>
                    <li><strong>&#167;&#339;&#1364;</strong> generates a very broad range of
                        characters. Output is likely to include some characters that are
                        undisplayable on your system and may occasionally output
                        undefined/nonexistent characters.</li>
                    <li><strong>Latin</strong> generates only characters in the Latin script
                        (specifically the first six Unicode blocks).</li>
                    <li>Options <strong>Greek</strong>, <strong>Cyrillic</strong>, etc on through
                            <strong>CJK</strong> generate characters only from that specific
                        script.</li>
                    <li>Options such as <strong>Letterlike</strong>, <strong>IPA</strong>,
                            <strong>Shapes</strong>, etc generate various types of "fun"
                        characters.</li>
                </ul> This panel is collapsed by default.</li>
            <li>The <strong>font panel</strong> lets the user set a font color, change the font, set
                the text to bold and/or italics, and set whether the text is left-aligned, centered,
                or right-aligned. It is collapsed by default.</li>
            <li>The <strong>shadow panel</strong> has a check box to turn shadows on/off, choose the
                shadow color, set the shadow's x/y position relative to the text, and set how blurry
                or crisp the shadow is. It is collapsed by default.</li>
            <li>The <strong>rotate panel</strong> has controls to rotate the output text, as well as
                move the x/y position of the rotation axis. These controls may not work as you
                expect &mdash; or rotated elements may end up in front of controls, making them
                unclickable &mdash; so Recenter and Reset buttons are also provided. This panel is
                collapsed by default.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition to controls for choosing the number and background color, there are also
            three buttons that affect the whole screen:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <strong>FreeFonts button</strong> changes the font on some controls to make it easier
            to work with characters that aren't in the basic fonts:
            <ul>
                <li>Changes the font on the "type something" boxes to Symbola, which is great for working with Pictographs and such.</li>
                <li>Changes the font of the "choose diacritic" drop-downs to FreeSans, so you can work with diacritics that aren't in the base fonts
                    (like Combining Diacritical Marks for Symbols).</li>
            </ul>
                (You must <a href="http://shapecatcher.com/unicodefonts.html">download and install</a>
                the Symbola and Free* fonts for this mode to work. The fonts are free, and are highly recommended.)
            </li>
            <li>The <strong>Redraw button</strong> redraws the entire screen. You might want to use
                this if some of your diacritics aren't visible, or if your screen is full of glitch
                artifacts from resizing or rotating things, and you want to clear them away.</li>
            <li>The <strong>Hide controls button</strong> hides all controls (except for an Unhide
                button) so that you can take prettier screenshots.</li>
            <li>The <strong>Hide and redraw button</strong> both hides all controls and redraws the
                screen. Click this if the Hide controls button created glitch artifacts that you
                don't want, or if some of your diacritics aren't showing up onscreen and you want to
                take a screenshot.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Tips for using the text art canvas</h2>
        <p>Your experience will probably be <em>greatly</em> enhanced by installing <a
                href="http://shapecatcher.com/unicodefonts.html">these Unicode fonts</a>.</p>
        <p>When you add diacritics to existing text, you end up with text that is taller than the
            "box" it's in. Diacritics outside this box may not appear onscreen right away. You can
            force them to appear using one of the Redraw buttons, but this also clears the screen of
            artifacts that you might want to keep. In this case, try resizing the text. </p>
        <p>The "box" holding each line of text runs to the edge of the screen, no matter how short
            your text is. So if you rotate any text, part of this box could end up "in front of"
            some of the controls, making them unclickable. The rotate panel has Recenter and Reset
            buttons, but these too can be blocked. If this happens, try resizing the text or
            expanding/collapsing panels to move things around until you can click them.</p>
        <p>Leaving spaces in your source text allows the text to wrap to multiple lines. This can
            give interesting results, particularly if the font size is large. </p>
        <p>Using Chrome or Safari adds extra glitchy behaviors that you may find desirable, due to
            the aforementioned optimization bug. </p>
        <p>The most diacritic-friendly fonts are Helvetica/Arial, Times, and Tahoma. Courier
            displays diacritics but doesn't stack them vertically, instead placing them in a grid
            that you might or might not find useful.</p>
        <p>Empty squares/rectangles represent undisplayable characters. Choosing a different font
            may help, but Unicode is massive, and you likely don't have fonts installed for all
            every Unicode character, unless you installed those extra fonts. </p>
        <p>There are different blocks of diacritical marks, and some characters are picky about
            which ones they take: Arabic diacritics work on Latin characters, but Latin diacritics
            don't work on Arabic letters. The buttons that generate random diacritics attempt to
            pick the "right" type to generate, but you can deliberately try to apply the "wrong"
            ones using the precise panel. It might work, or you might just get a bunch of empty
            squares.</p>
        <p>Diacritics do not stack well in all types of text. When they don't stack correctly, they
            may appear as dotted circles, so repeatedly trying to add diacritics can result in large
            numbers of these circles. </p>
        <h2>Saving your work</h2>
        <p>The glitch text generator and text art canvas does not have a "save" function, but:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Glitch text can be easily copied and pasted to other environments &mdash; Facebook,
                Tumblr, Twitter, etc all support this beautifully. If you find a site where pasting
                glitch text doesn't seem to work (for example, Google Plus), then try using a base
                script opther than Latin (Letterlike, IPA, and Thai are good choices) and adding
                diacritics to that. (Usually, the problem is the font the site is using. Google Plus
                uses its own custom font, for example. Using non-Latin characters can "trick" the
                site into using a different font to display those characters.)</li>
            <li>Keep work you've created using the text art canvas by <a
                    href="http://www.take-a-screenshot.org/">taking a screenshot</a>. Then consider
                submitting your screenshots (or gifs made using them, etc) to the <a
                    href="http://glitchtext.tumblr.com/">glitch text tumblr</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Terms of [mis]use</h2>

        <p>You may use glitch text and text art that you create using the HTML5 glitch text
            generator in any way. It's your art; I just made the tool. If you choose to publish your
            art, it would be great if you could include a link to <a
                href="http://animalswithinanimals.com/generator/"
                >animalswithinanimals.com/generator/</a>. Also, I'd love it if you submitted your
            screenshots, animated gifs, etc to the <a href="http://glitchtext.tumblr.com">glitch
                text tumblr</a> at <a href="http://glitchtext.tumblr.com/submit"
                >glitchtext.tumblr.com/submit</a>.</p>
        <p>You may use the glitch text scripts in your own projects. If you do, it's better for me
            if you upload the file to your own server than if you link to my server. You may alter
            the scripts if your project requires it, but don't try to pass it all off as your own
            work, because that would be a total jerk move. Also, don't try to make money off these
            scripts without cutting me in on the deal, because that's not cool, either.</p>
        <p>If you use the scripts in a project, it would be great if you could include a link to <a
                href="http://animalswithinanimals.com/generator/"
                >animalswithinanimals.com/generator/</a>. If you do something interesting with these
            scripts or expand them in some cool way, I'd love if you let me know by emailing me at
            stallio@animalswithinanimals.com or submitting a link to the <a
                href="http://glitchtext.tumblr.com">glitch text tumblr</a> at <a
                href="http://glitchtext.tumblr.com/submit">glitchtext.tumblr.com/submit</a>.</p>
